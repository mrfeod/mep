SMS messages in Cyprus usually arrive with Greek text written using a mix of Greek and visually similar Latin characters. For example, the Latin letters `A`, `B`, `E`, `K`, `M`, `T` look identical to their Greek counterparts but are different characters.
It helps to save bytes on SMS messages, but makes them unreadable for online translators. 

This tool helps to convert such mixed text back into proper Greek, ensuring readability and correct representation. In addition, it has an integrated translation feature.
